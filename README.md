# My Paper-Folding Theory

<br>
<br>
This printout shows how many angular degrees are consumed per fold for the required range that would signify a valid fold, being 180 degrees turn of the paper, with each step consuming one-half of the remaining range from the fold before it.
<br>
<br>
One fold is 180 degrees of angular torsion, and the layers of the fold converge on the fold to reduce the range of additional tortion by one half for each fold of the paper.
<br>
<br>
The known limit, which is 11 folds before it becomes impossible to fold a piece of paper again, is the first in the series that is a repeating decimal of the prior value, and so we can see that a limit point is reached where progress becomes immpossible or extremely difficult.
<br>
<br>
The common limit that people usually report getting is 7 folds before they cannot fold a piece of paper or any other material any further, and in my series here that is the first step in which the net gain in torsion is a fraction of one, and efficiency is lost at this point so it is the initial beginning of the loss of efficiency in torsion achieved per halving, and so it becomes exponentially more difficult at that point to achieve the next fold.
